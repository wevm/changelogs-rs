# Changelog

## 0.9.1 (2026-09-07)

### Patch Changes

- Support Python packages using Core Metadata 2.5 by upgrading the pinned Twine publisher. (by @ParvAhuja, [#148](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/148))
- Use Tempo's vendored Peter Evans pull request action so release workflows comply with the organization action policy while preserving upstream behavior. (by @DerekCofausper, [#159](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/159))

## 0.9.0 (2026-07-27)

### Minor Changes

- Added idempotent private Rust package selection and automatic binary-only workspace discovery for registry-free versioning and tags. (by @jxom, [#140](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/140))

## 0.8.2 (2026-07-27)

### Patch Changes

- Authenticated tag pushes with the workflow token and explicitly dispatched binary release builds. (by @jxom, [#138](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/138))

## 0.8.1 (2026-06-02)

### Patch Changes

- Gate PyPI authentication setup to the explicit Python ecosystem so non-Python release workflows that use OIDC for their own registry do not attempt PyPI trusted publishing. (by @EmmaJamieson-Hoare, [#119](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/119))

## 0.8.0 (2026-05-02)

### Minor Changes

- Add support for [PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)
- (OIDC). When `pypi-token` is empty and the workflow has `id-token: write`,
- the action mints a short-lived PyPI API token by exchanging the GitHub
- OIDC ID token at PyPI's `_/oidc/mint-token` endpoint, removing the need
- for a long-lived static API token. Existing static-token usage is
- unchanged. (by @BrendanRyan, [#116](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/116))

## 0.7.0 (2026-05-02)

### Minor Changes

- Added support for a `.changelog/instructions.md` file to override the default AI prompt, with priority order: `--instructions` flag > `.changelog/instructions.md` > built-in default. Updated README with documentation for this feature. (by @DerekCofausper, [#67](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/67))

### Patch Changes

- Two release-mode fixes:
- **Go ecosystem.** `is_published` now treats `v0.0.0` as already published, so a Go module with no prior `vX.Y.Z` tag and no staged changelog entries does not get bootstrap-tagged on every push to the release branch. The previous behavior unconditionally created and pushed a `v0.0.0` tag the first time the release workflow ran on an integrated repo.
- **GitHub Action.** The "Create GitHub releases" step's previous-tag lookup uses `git tag --list … | grep -Fxv -- "$tag" | head -1`. `grep -Fxv` exits 1 when every input line matches the excluded pattern (i.e. when the only tag is `$tag` itself), and under `set -e -o pipefail` that aborted the whole step before any release was created. Both occurrences are now guarded with `{ grep -Fxv … || true; }`, so the lookup degrades to "no previous tag" instead of failing the step. (by @BrendanRyan, [#111](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/111))
- Added Go module ecosystem support. Discovers single-module Go projects via `go.mod`, persists the bumped version inline as a `// changelogs:version X.Y.Z` comment between the version and publish CI runs, edits `require` blocks for dependency updates, queries `proxy.golang.org` for published-version checks, and emits `vX.Y.Z` git tags. Auto-detection (`go.mod` at the repository root) and the `go` / `golang` ecosystem aliases are wired through. (by @BrendanRyan, [#109](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/109))

## 0.6.5 (2026-04-25)

### Patch Changes

- Update rustls-webpki 0.103.11 → 0.103.13 to fix RUSTSEC-2026-0098, RUSTSEC-2026-0099, RUSTSEC-2026-0104. (by @grandizzy, [#107](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/107))

## 0.6.4 (2026-04-14)

### Patch Changes

- Fixed changelog directory lookup to support hyphenated package names by stripping the first prefix segment as a fallback (e.g., `tempo-alloy` -> `alloy`). Also improved release notes extraction to match both backtick-wrapped tag headings and plain version headings. (by @DerekCofausper, [#87](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/87))

## 0.6.3 (2026-03-18)

### Patch Changes

- Added support for unified versioning in root changelog format by implicitly treating all workspace packages as a fixed group, merging duplicate version headings and deduplicating changelog entries. Added Rust workspace version inheritance support for reading and writing versions via `version.workspace = true`. (by @Kartik, [#79](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/79))

## 0.6.2 (2026-03-17)

### Patch Changes

- Fixed config template placing `ignore` after `[changelog]` header causing it to be silently dropped. Respect `publish = false` in Cargo.toml by skipping unpublishable crates. Filter ignored packages during `publish` command. Added `SkipReason` enum to distinguish skip reasons in output. (by @Kartik, [#72](https://github.com/tempoxyz/changelogs/pull/72))

## 0.6.1 (2026-02-10)

### Patch Changes

- Truncated AI diff to 32KB to prevent "Prompt is too long" errors with AI commands that have smaller context windows. (by @jxom, [c3a9576](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs/commit/c3a9576))

## 0.6.0 (2026-02-04)

### Minor Changes

- Replaced auto-generate workflow with check action that comments on PRs with changelog status and optional AI-generated previews. (by @jxom, [#37](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/37))

### Patch Changes

- Fixed PR number detection to find the *first* merge commit that brought a changelog file into the branch, rather than the most recent one. This prevents incorrect PR attribution on release branches where later merges could incorrectly claim authorship. (by @jxom, [#40](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/40))

## `changelogs@0.5.2`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed per-crate changelog format to include package and version header in individual CHANGELOG.md files. Updated GitHub Action to look for changelogs in per-crate directories before falling back to root CHANGELOG.md. (by @jxom, [#33](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs/pull/33))

## `changelogs@0.5.1`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed token validation to check for empty strings instead of just missing environment variables. (by @jxom, [#31](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs/pull/31))

## `changelogs@0.5.0`

### Minor Changes

- Added support for creating git tags without registry tokens, allowing the tool to be used for version management even when package publishing is not configured. (by @jxom, [#29](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs/pull/29))

## `changelogs@0.4.2`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed release mode to run without requiring registry tokens, allowing tag creation and GitHub releases for all projects. (by @BrendanRyan, [#27](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs/pull/27))

## `changelogs@0.4.1`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed release notes formatting by adding blank line before GitHub extras section. (by @jxom, [#24](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/24))
- Fixed error message when ecosystem is not detected to provide clear instructions with the --ecosystem flag, and added -e shorthand for the ecosystem argument. (by @jxom, [#24](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/24))

## `changelogs@0.4.0`

### Minor Changes

- Added `changelogs up` command for self-update functionality and improved install script with automatic PATH configuration for multiple shells. (by @jxom, [#20](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/20))

## `changelogs@0.3.0`

### Minor Changes

- Added Python ecosystem support with both PEP 621 and Poetry formats. (by @BrendanRyan, [#17](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/17))

## `changelogs@0.2.1`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed action. (by @jxom, [411d91e](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/commit/411d91e))

## `changelogs@0.2.0`

### Minor Changes

- Added automatic installation of changelogs binary in GitHub Actions with caching support, and simplified action inputs by removing customizable version/publish commands in favor of hardcoded changelogs commands. (by @jxom, [#10](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/10))

## `changelogs@0.1.1`

### Patch Changes

- Fixed GitHub releases to use changelog content from CHANGELOG.md instead of auto-generated notes. (by @jxom, [#7](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/pull/7))

## `changelogs@0.1.0`

### Minor Changes

- Added AI-assisted changelog generation. Users can now generate changelog entries from git diffs using the `--ai` flag with commands like `changelogs add --ai "claude -p"`. Includes a GitHub Action for automated PR changelog generation and configuration options for custom AI commands and instructions. (by @jxom, [e8740e8](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/commit/e8740e8))

### Patch Changes

- Updated README with improved workflow documentation, added mermaid diagram showing development and release process, documented AI changelog generation with GitHub Actions setup, and clarified the Release Candidate workflow. (by @jxom, [e8740e8](https://github.com/wevm/changelogs-rs/commit/e8740e8))

## `changelogs@0.0.1`
